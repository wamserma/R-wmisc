# WMisc - because everyone should have his own misc package

## Huh?

This is a collection of helper functions I wrote for myself. 


## Building the Package manually

clone the git repository

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/wamserma/WMisc.git 
```

install the build dependencies

```r
install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat", "knitr"))
```

open project in RStudio and hit `Ctrl + Shift + L`
